# Support Vector Machines (SVM)

This project demonstrates the use of Support Vector Machines for binary classification using the Breast Cancer dataset.

## Objectives

- Train SVM with both linear and RBF kernel
- Visualize decision boundaries using PCA
- Tune and evaluate using cross-validation

## Tools

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Files

- svm_classification.py : Main code file

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python and the required libraries:
   ```
   pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```
   python svm_classification.py
   ```

## Output

- Console: Accuracy of linear and RBF kernels
- Graphs: 2D decision boundary plots
